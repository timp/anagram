The problem, eventually overwhelming, was the quality of the words in words.txt.

It contained many non-words and many short ones at that.
As we use the dictionary to define the possible words having nonsense
in the dictionary does not work, also we want as small a dictionary as possible.
Words.txt still contained 230011 words after many silly words had been removed.

Instead we use the smaller (60388) file 2of4brif.txt from http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts/
This dictionary contains British english, no abbreviations, no acronyms,
no hyphenations, no names, no phrases but inflections.
Note that the word 'a' and I were not included, but added manually.

Other choices can be made from the zip file of dictionaries.
